"final_buffered_boundary.py" is a python code which takes list of country names as input and and will return a output json file named 
"country_buffer_data.csv" which will contain multiple polygon shapes. All the polygons of a particular country are named as 
"country_name{polygon number}". Example, as taiwan is made from multiple polygons so the output file will contain Id name = Taiwan1 or Taiwan2.

To USE "final_buffered_boundary.py" RUN command : "python3 final_buffered_boundary.py $buffer_distance $correction_accuracy $Country_name1 $Country_name2  $Country_name3 ...."
buffere_distance:(dtype=float) ; correction_accuracy:(dtype=int) ; Country_name:(dtype=string)

To find the place where you have to spcify the input in the code search for word " INPUT " in the python file.

"buffer_earthquake_selector.py" which use "country_buffer_data.csv" which is the output of "final_buffered_boundary.py" and the countries
earthquake catalog in proper format (CSV file containing columns named "latitude", "longitude" with floating number values) as input and will give a
CSV file as output which will only contain the data whose coordinates are within the country buffer mentioned in "country_buffer_data.csv" the output
file will be named as "final_merge_(country name).csv".

To USE "buffer_earthquake_selector.py" RUN command : "python3 buffer_earthquake_selector.py"

"Catalogs" foder contains the merged catalogs used to find the earthquakes which happened within the buffer region of the country.

"country_buffered_catalogs" folder contains the catalogs with earthquakes within the buffer boundary.

"final_buffer_boundary_plotter.py" is a python programme which ask for company name or ISO3 code as mentioned in "TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.dbf" as input
and plot raw and final country boundary with latitude and longitude as axis, this can be plotted on map or a globe to get clear picture.

IMPORTANT NOTE :- All the input files used by the functions in this folder should be present in the same directory as the program. These include
4 shapefiles named "TM_WORLD_BORDERS-0.3.*", the catalogs which will be used as input for buffer earthquake selector, "country_buffer_data.csv"
which should contain buffer boundary info about the country for which we have to select the earthquakes and this can be done by inputting the country
name in "final_buffer_boundary.py".
